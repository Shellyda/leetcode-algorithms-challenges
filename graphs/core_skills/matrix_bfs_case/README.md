# Matrix Breath-First Search

- ðŸ§© Problem link: [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/problems/matrixBFS)
- ðŸš¦ Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Purpose

You are given a binary matrix `Grid` where `0`s represent land and `1`s represent rocks that can not be traversed.

Return the length of the shortest path from the top-left corner of `Grid` to the bottom-right corner such that all traversed cells are land cells. You may only move vertically or horizontally through land cells.

### Note:

- If there is no such path, return `-1`.
- The length of a path is the number of moves from the starting cell to the ending cell.

### Example 1:

```cpp
Input: grid = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0, 0]
]

Output:
6
```

## ðŸ•’ Time and Space Complexity

- Time: O(m\*n)
- Space: O(m\*n)

## âœ… Solution

```cpp
// your code here
```
