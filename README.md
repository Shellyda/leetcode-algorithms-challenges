# Leetcode Study Vault

This repository was created as a way to deepen understanding of **algorithms** and **data structures** by solving problems from Leetcode.
Each solution is documented to serve as both a **reference** and a **personal learning log**.

> It is structured in a way that makes it easy to review, revisit, and expand my problem-solving knowledge over time.

## Topics

1. [Arrays](./arrays)
2. [Linked Lists](./linked_lists)
3. [Recursion](./recursion)
4. [Sorting](./sorting)
5. [Binary Search](./binary_search)
6. [Trees](./trees)
7. [Backtracking](./backtracking)
8. [Heap](./heap)
9. [Hashing](./hashing)
10. [Graphs](./graphs)
11. [Dynamic Programming](./dynamic_programming)
12. [Bit Manipulation](./bit_manipulation)

## Repository Structure

Organized by topic (e.g., `arrays`, `graph`, `dp`). Each problem is in a numbered folder with a slug:

```
📁 arrays/
  ├── 001_two_sum/
  │   ├── solution.cpp
  │   └── README.md
```

## Content Documentation: How to Add a New Problem

I created this script to help with documentation and repository organization. Here's how to use it:

#### 1. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x add_problem.sh
```

#### 2. Run it:

```bash
./add_problem.sh
```

It will prompt you for:

- Category (e.g., `arrays/binarysearch`)
- Problem title
- Difficulty (optional)

It then creates a folder with:

- `solution.cpp`
- `README.md`
  And updates all README files automatically.
