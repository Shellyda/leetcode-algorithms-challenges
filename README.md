# Leetcode Study Vault

## Purpose
This repository was created as a way to deepen understanding of **algorithms** and **data structures** by solving problems from Leetcode.
Each solution is documented to serve as both a **reference** and a **personal learning log**.

It is structured in a way that makes it easy to review, revisit, and expand my problem-solving knowledge over time.

## Repository Structure

Organized by topic (e.g., `arrays`, `graph`, `dp`). Each problem is in a numbered folder with a slug:

📁 `arrays/`
  ├── `001_two_sum/`
  │   ├── `solution.cpp`
  │   └── `README.md`

## How to Add a New Problem
I created this script to help with documentation and repository organization. Here's how to use it:

### 1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x add_problem.sh
```

### 2. Run it:
```bash
./add_problem.sh
```

It will prompt you for:
- Category (e.g., `arrays/binarysearch`)
- Problem title
- Difficulty (optional)

It then creates a folder with:
- `solution.cpp`
- `README.md`
And updates all README files automatically.
